# Iris Flower Classification

This project demonstrates the classification of iris flowers into three species: **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, and **Virginica**. It uses the popular Iris dataset and implements machine learning models to predict the species based on the flower's features.

## Overview

Iris Flower Classification is a classic machine learning problem that uses a simple dataset with four features:  
- Sepal Length  
- Sepal Width  
- Petal Length  
- Petal Width  

This project explores different machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to build a classification model.
